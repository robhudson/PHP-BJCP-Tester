This PHP script is intended to quiz oneself on Beer Judge Certification Program
(BJCP) styles in preparation for the test.

The BJCP Styles Test will randomly choose 10 BJCP styles and ask you to choose
the correct range out of a choice of 3 for each of: OG, FG, IBU, SRM, and ABV.
After each question you'll be presented with the correct answer and a score. At
the end of the 10 styles you'll be presented with an overall score and a
listing of those styles you did well on, and those you didn't. You can choose
to torture yourself more if you want to.

NOTE: This test and data are based on the 1997 BJCP styles which are very out
of date at this point.
