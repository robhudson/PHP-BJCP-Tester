<h2>BJCP Styles Test</h2>
<p>
The BJCP Styles Test will randomly choose 10 BJCP styles and ask you to choose
the correct range out of a choice of 3 for each of: OG, FG, IBU, SRM, and ABV.
After each question you'll be presented with the correct answer and a score.
At the end of the 10 styles you'll be presented with an overall score and a
listing of those styles you did well on, and those you didn't.  You can choose
to torture yourself more if you want to.
